# WinSys
C++ library for low-level Windows development

I'm extracting this from the SystemExplorer project (doing some cleanup and other modifications), so it would be easier to use in other projects.

Several tools are developed based on WinSys (in the Tools directory):

* QSlice
* TaskMgrX (WIP)
